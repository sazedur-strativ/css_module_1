    <h1>Chicken Vindaloo</h1>
    <p>
      “Vindaloo” is a popular Indian <a href="">curry dish</a> that calls for
      meat to be marinated in a highly flavorful spicy mixture with vinegar,
      then quickly cooked up when you’re ready to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this dish has a long list of spices, most are quite common in the
      average spice rack. If you find you're missing one, it's not a deal
      breaker. You will still have a lovely, fragrant curry.
